# OpenAVM
OpenAVM is a web app designed to aid in the typesetting of attribute-value matrices (AVMs), particularly those used in the framework of Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG).

The app allows users to create a structure of embedded square and curly brackets. The structure of the brackets and the text input by the user are used to produce a TeX file, which is then sent to latexonline.cc (thanks to @aslushnikov) to be compiled into a .pdf.

Below is an LFG f-structure for the sentence 'Gramps planted a turnip.'
